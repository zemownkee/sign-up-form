# sign-up-form
Demo sign-up-form written with HTML and CSS 

This was built as an assignment during The Odin Project courses. The suggested design which you can see here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png
or find the design.png file in the img directory.

Some design elements were re-created identically and others were adapted due to lack of information.

This is a project to demonstrate front-end concepts only. 
Form styling, page layout, and client-side validatation are addressed in this.
