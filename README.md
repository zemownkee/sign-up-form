# sign-up-form
Demo sign-up-form with JavaScript client-side validation.

This project was to demonstrate page layout with some very basic responsive design concepts.

Form validation is done with JavaScript just as an exercise and to experiment with Form UX concepts. Most of the validation done in the form could be done with pure CSS more simply, I just wanted to play with some JavaScript.

This was built as an assignment during The Odin Project courses. The suggested design which you can see here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png
or find the design.png file in the img directory.

Some design elements were re-created identically and others were adapted based on personal taste.
